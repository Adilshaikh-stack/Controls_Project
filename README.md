In this report we will analyze a system consisting of inverted pendulum mounted to motorized cart. Inverted pendulum is often implemented on a cart that can move horizontally. We know that the pendulum is stable hanging downwards and when disturbed or given force to it to keep it in upward direction then it becomes unstable. We will model the inverted pendulum system and analyze it with different parameters to observe under what conditions it becomes stable.
